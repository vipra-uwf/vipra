# API Documentation

The documentation was created through the use of Doxygen in tandem with GitHub actions. 
Doxygen is automatically run to compile this webpage by pulling .md files for Related Pages and linking together properly formatted comments to create the API, which can be found under the Classes tab at the top. Instructions for this are found in the Doxyfile under the main vipra/ folder.
