// Example DSLs (non-functional)
// Consider + a(n) + person_type - registers a new type of person
Consider a "Shy person".

// A(n) person_type "wants to" registers a non-critical preference for that person
// "be 10 meters away from" indicates a preferred distance between two points
// "other people" indicates the target for the previous preference. In this case, other pedestrians
A "Shy person" wants to be 10 meters away from other people.

If a "Shy person" finds themselves within 10 meters of another person,
Then they will move 1 meter opposite of that person.

// "10% of the population" - indicates the slice size
// "identify as a(n)" - what follows is a person_type
// person_type - the aforementioned person_type
10% of the population identify as a "Shy person".


// Travelling party of size X.
Consider a "Traveling Party".

A "Traveling Party" consists of N people.

A member of a "Traveling Party" wants to be at most 2 meters away from other members of the same "Traveling Party".

30% of the population form a "Traveling Party" of 2 people.
10% of the population form a "Traveling Party" of 3 people.
 5% of the population form a "Traveling Party" of 4 people.


// At this point the rules-engine can parse this file, and add "forces" on each pedestrian position _after_ it has been made.
// For example, if the new position of a "Shy person" brings them in conflict with one of the rules, the remediation actions can be taken.

// Model Input
// - Time
// - Positions, relative to each other
// - What they are doing?? i.e., their movement state. Are they stopped? Moving slowly?
// - What is their speed?
// Model Output
// - Pedestrian data (positions)
// - modifies internal state?

// NOTE: We should allow for a stateful-model - store arbitrary information for
// each person.

// From Dr. Eddy:
// If a passenger is unloading luggage, a "shy person" will wait. If a passenger is unloading baggage, a "rude person" will push behind.

A person that is stopped 1 meter in front of an obstacle is unloading luggage.

// From Dr. Srinivasan:
// reactions of sudden speed changes could be important to model

// We should add contextual information to the obstacle JSON that can assist with
// modelling human behaviors.

// Features that are needed to be captured
// Goals
// Other concepts
// Anything the user can add through the DSL

// Make it extensible

// In the context of _human_ behaviors, the exact speed may not be our starting
// point. We could go with the state of "moving" or "not moving".
// We want the researchers to define these states in the DSL, and describe the
// transitions in the DSL too. Researchers can define more complex options.
