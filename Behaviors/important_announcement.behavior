Consider an announcement_listener.

Everyone is an announcement_listener.

Possible Pedestrian States are #listening, and #normal.

The !announcement event will occur after 2 seconds from !start and end after 5 seconds from !announcement.

An announcement_listener will @be set to #listening when an !announcement event starts.

An announcement_listener will @be set to #normal when an !announcement event ends.
